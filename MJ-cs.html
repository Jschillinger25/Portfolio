        <h3>Introduction </h3>
        <p>I’m interested in design that benefits others. I want to help those that may not have the experience or resources to execute a functionally aesthetic design. That’s why when I was approached by a friend (aka stakeholder), eager to grow her wedding photography business, I immediately agreed to assist. She didn’t have a website, which can be a real death sentence for a small business. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "column full">
        <h3>Problem and Solution </h3>
        <p> Building a competitive website was my primary concern. There are numerous professional photographers who have exceptional sites and I needed to design Mj Photography to be a competitor! To design a site that would entice users to book my stakeholder's services, I needed to research and find out what was working and what wasn’t working with competitors' sites.

    <div class = "SwotSurvey column full">
        <h3>SWOT Analyses and Survey </h3>
        <p>Choosing one wedding photography site from three different regions of the country,  I conducted SWOT analyses to determine the strengths and weaknesses of each site and glean takeaways to use in my own design.
        </p>

    </div>
    <div class = "SwotSurvey column full">
        <p>I noticed a few big trends with the three sites I researched as well as others that are highly awarded and recognized in the industry: <br><br> 1. Minimalism. Adding a lot of whitespace gives the site a cleaner and more luxurious feel and that feeling keeps users around! <br><br>2. Prices and packaging. This information was surprisingly absent from the three sites I researched. <br><br>3. Portfolio. The portfolio is certainly the focal point of any photographer’s website because it showcases their artistic quality and it's a major decider for users on who they will hire.
        <br><br> Just because something is a trend doesn't always mean it's a good thing. I decided to include a couple questions about the last two trends in a survey to see what users think. The majority of responses informed me that users prefer to see packages and prices listed on the website right away without having to inquire. This became a focal point of what I hoped to achieve with Mj Photography. For the last trend, the survey confirmed that a competitive portfolio would be essential.

        <h3> Brand Identity </h3>
        <p>Now that I had researched my competitors and interviewed my users it was time to start on the brand identity! Pearls are symbolic for weddings so I decided to try incorporating that into the logo. I discovered quickly through testing that users thought the pearl outline was actually an eyeball and didn’t really see the pearls. Also, it wasn't very scalable. I chose a circle design instead which resonated with users more.

         <p>I knew from a conversation with my stakeholder that she wanted the <b>typography</b> to be fancy to show elegance but I also knew it needed to be balanced out so that it would be legible. I chose Great Vibes for the cursive since it is a beautifully connecting font and fairly popular in the United States. Raleway was chosen for the sans-serif because of its elegance.

        <p>The <b>colors</b> for Mj Photography started out darker, with deep blues and purples but through user testing I discovered that the colors gave the website a dark and constrained appearance so I continued refining and ended up with a lighter palette of blues and pinks, with darker text colors.

        <h3>Mockups </h3>
        <p> Despite the research I had conducted, my stakeholder was really interested in a darker color palette for a more mysterious air. I decided to do a few mockups for her to view so I could then explain to her with visuals what the research was saying about whitespace. When she saw the darker mockups she agreed that the site would be improved with more spacing and brighter colors. Below are the first drafts of the mockups with darker colors and more fancy text used throughout the site. You’ll then see the finished product and what a difference it makes to add space, brighter colors, and more legible typography throughout.

         The packages page also went through several revisions due to conversations with my stakeholder and user testing. The packages page started out very dark with limited hierarchy. The second draft shows a drastic difference in color, typography, and added hierarchy. The final draft gives us more whitespace and a luxurious space to explore.

         Originally I did not have a package details page but after interviewing some users I discovered it would be beneficial to have a page that gave more information about each package. Below are two drafts of the details page. The final draft simplifies the information hierachy and makes it easier to view and digest.

      <p>The research I had conducted earlier in my process informed me that a portfolio was going to be of utmost importance. As a result, I dedicated time to finding the most responsive and functional way to build it. I knew from my research I did not want to have a long scrolling page but I also did not want to solely rely on a carousel with no gallery. As a result, I found a method using Javascript that would allow me to showcase thumbnail photos when the album is clicked into but also to click a photo, view it full size, and then click through a carousel of the other photos. This method provided users with multiple options.

      I have two final points: <br><br>1. The navigation bar was drastically changed in the final draft because of expert feedback. The cluttered appearance and redundant links of the original top navigation led to a positive redirection.<br><br>2. I added unique scrolling interactions and animations to the site which these mockups do not have the capacity to showcase.

        <h3> Final Thoughts </h3>
        <p>This project was interesting to me because I desire to help people by using my ability to design.  Working directly with a stakeholder to produce a winning design was a unique and rewarding experience. We had to work closely together to balance user feedback, my expertise and her own valuable opinions about how to present a competitive photography site.  Even when communications became strained or advice was not received as expected, the result was rewarding because there was always a way to make accommodations.  In the end, I have enabled my friend to go further in her professional journey and I look forward to doing the same with many others!
