        <h3>Introduction </h3>
        <p> I’m interested in design that benefits others. I want to help those that  may not have the know-how, experience, or resources to execute what’s needed for a functional design. That’s why when I was approached by a friend, eager to grow her wedding photography business, I immediately agreed to assist. She didn’t have a functional website, which in this day and age can be a real death sentence for a small business. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "column full">
        <h3>Problem </h3>
        <p> The competition we stood up against was enormous.
        There were several professional photographers in the area with lavish looking sites and we needed to find ways to be exceptional.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class = "column full">
        <h3>Solution </h3>
        <p>To design a site that would entice users to book my friend's services I needed to do a lot of research and find out what was working and what wasn’t working with competitors sites. By gathering that information, I could then incorporate the best ideas from other sites while minimizing aspects of the sites that wouldn’t be as functional or desired.  
        </p>

    <div class = "SwotSurvey column full">
        <h3>SWOT Analyses and Survey </h3>
        <p>The first things I did was research the local competitors and complete a SWOT analysis. That’s when I noticed the trend among award-winning photographers to keep their sites very minimalistic (a lot of whitespace) with more emphasis on the portfolio and less on the packages and cost. I was interested  in this trend so I conducted a survey with 27 participants to see what they thought about the choice of emphasis from these award-winning photographers. 
        </p>
        <p>I discovered that while the industry trend is to avoid disclosing prices online (packages are very quote based or “packages start at…”) the majority of users would prefer to see packages and prices listed on the website right away without having to inquire further. This became a focal point of what I hoped to achieve with the website. I would include a package page with prices that would outline what services the customer would be receiving and the cost. I also learned that the portfolio work is a decision maker for users viewing a photography site so we needed to emphasize that section.

        <h3> Brand Identity </h3>
        <p>Before launching into the mockups it was time to start with the brand identity. Pearls are symbolic for weddings so I decided to try incorporating that into the <b>logo</b>. I discovered quickly through testing that users thought the logo was an eyeball and didn’t really see the pearls. Also, it wasn't very scalable. I designed a circle instead with the MJ from MJ Photography breaking the barriers of the circle.

    <div class = "column full">
         <p>The <b>typography </b> needed to be fancy to show elegance but not so fancy that it wasn’t legible! I had to find a balance and determine the areas where fancy text would be appropriate and where a more legible font would be necessary. I ended up deciding on Pinyon Script for the fancy text and Lato for the body text.
        </p>
        <p>The <b>colors</b> started out darker, with deep blues and purples but through user testing discovered that the colors incorporated into the mockups gave the website appearance a dark and constrained feeling so I continued refining and ended up with a lighter palette.

        <h3>Mockups </h3>
        <p> My friend was hoping for her site to convey a royal, elegant feeling so the layout of the mockups in the beginning catered to that feeling she was after. The typography was fancy throughout the site and the colors were darker to give an air of mystery. It didn’t take long into the process though to realize how constrained the site appeared. Through much user testing and revision I ended up with my finished product being more minimalistic, and lighter in appearance, thus drawing curious users in.

        <h3> Final Thoughts </h3>
        <p>This project was interesting to me because of my desire to work with people and help them on their journeys through using my ability to design. I talk about wanting to help people all the time but this project provided me an actual opportunity to do that. It was also a unique experience to actually work with my stakeholder (aka my friend) and collaborate with her directly! I had to design a project with her feelings and desires specifically in mind and then work with her on solutions to every problem down the line. I had to balance user research and feedback, my stakeholder's opinions, and my own expertise to design a competitive wedding photography site! Working with people can be frustrating at times but it is so rewarding, especially when I’m able to produce something good for them that can help them on their professional journey.
