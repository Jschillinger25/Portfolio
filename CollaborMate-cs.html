        <h3> The Introduction </h3>
        <p> From the onset, this project had two goals, one personal and one practical. My personal was to dissect and understand the design process from beginning to end to be able to conceptualize and present a materialized product. The practical aim of the project was to create a platform for multiple users to share multiple types of media in order to collaborate on a project. CollaborMate set out to help people on a project but CollaborMate helped me learn how to develop a project.

        <h3> The Problem </h3>
        <p> My design team and I were brought on board to become acquainted with project development by creating a stylish simple way for teams to collaborate on projects in a digital space. The goals was to the learn the ins and outs of design and working as a team to accomplish a goal while also building a space for others to do the same. Living in a digital world it’s increasingly difficult to work as a team on projects if you don’t have a digital space to store all your media files and share them so they can be accessed from anywhere, anytime.

        <h3> The Solution </h3>
        <p> Our solution was to conduct a SWOT analysis of our competitors (Google Drive, Evernote, SimpleNote) and then figure out a branding strategy that would appeal to our users. We conducted surveys to discover who our primary users were and what was important to them. With our limited experience our solution was to listen to the instrusty experts, websites that are working, and our users to figure out how to structure the website. We then conducted several interviews and created Personas to help guide us in our design process.

        <h3> Brand Identity </h3>
        <p> We came up with a lot of intricate and detailed <b> logo designs </b> but quickly learned it was too taxing on the eyes for users and got overlooked because of how complicated they were. This weakened the brand identity. In addition to that we learned the importance of keeping it simple for the sake of scalability. Logos need to fit on multiple surfaces so they have to be able to scale down and up with ease. Because of this we needed to eliminate all the colors too because black and white is the most basic way to view it on multiple surfaces, especially those that are colored. User feedback and industry experts helped us to begin to understand the importance of these concepts when designing logos.

     <div class = "Text column full">
        <p> We had no idea in the beginning of this design process how much <b> color </b> affects brand identity. Our resources taught us that color has meaning. With a user first model we needed to get into the mind of our users to see how colors communicated meaning to them. Knowing this information would help us to choose a color palette that would allow our users to feel comfortable using our site. We started with bright colors but quickly discovered they didn’t provide us with the professional feeling we were going for so we ended up with the darker blues.

        <p> Through <b> wireframing, mockups, </b> and user and expert feedback we discovered where to best position our call to action buttons and we learned about hierarchy and how not all content is created equal and meant to be showcased. If everything looks important nothing looks important. As a result we learned how to properly position our content to attract the eye and give the user a focal point to begin to digest the information.

        <h3> Final Thoughts </h3>
        <p><b>What worked? </b> We designed a functional static site and achieved the goal of developing a project from start to finish. Doing UX helped us to make improved mockups and branding each iteration. 
        </p>
        <p><b>What didn't work?</b> We learned that sticking to simple guidelines created a generic website that wasn’t as compelling as we would have liked.
        </p>
        <p><b>Any surprises?</b> User feedback is more valuable that we anticipated. It identified not only different areas of opportunity but also areas of natural talent.
        </p>
        <p><b>Learning lessons:</b> We went from being unfamiliar with both the programs and processes of design to becoming acquainted with programs such as AI, PS, and Sketch. We learned about hierarchy, color palettes, typography, personas, user stories and all the other wonderful aspects that come into play in UX/UI and frontend development. This provides a platform for us to increase our expertise.
