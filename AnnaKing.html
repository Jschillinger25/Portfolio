        <h1>Anna King Bridal</h1> 
        <h2>2017 - UI Designer</h2>
      </div>

 <div class = "column full">
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p> Anna King Bridal came about through a design competition. I’m still not sure what the results of the competition are but regardless of whether I won or not I absolutely loved the way this design turned out.<br><br>
        I was given some guidelines for the competition that included the following:<br><br>
        1. Boost sales by enticing users to browse collections<br><br>
        2. Build trust<br><br>
        3. Create a feeling of luxury<br><br>
        4. Build customer loyalty
        </p>
 </div>
 <div class = "column full">
        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p> I took some time to brainstorm what solving each of these instructions might entail. Here are the results: <br><br>1. What normally entices users? Visually, it has to be something appealing, maybe an image or phrase that entices users to click and find out more. In my case I ended up using two  different means. I chose photos that were visually appealing, and I also included a sale banner upon hover that would entice users to click to find out more about the discounted offers.

        <p> 2. To build trust I incorporated a varity of features on the site. I included recommendations from well known people/magazines, payment options, a privacy info link, a counterfiet awareness link, and a quality guarantee. These things, working together, are meant to make users feel secure. They can be informed and purchase with confidence.

        <p> 3. To create a sense of luxury I maximized the whitespace. Whitespace is the difference between walking into a cluttered, dirty thrift store, and walking into an expensive department store. It gives users the freedom to browse and look around without cluttering their vision with needless animations or information. Everything on this landing page is there for a reason and it is calculated to not tax users.  <br><br>4. To build customer loyalty I added two features: I provided users the ability to enter a contest to win a free dress and I also provided the ability to sign up for Anna King’s newsletter so they could be the first to know about exclusive offers and the newest dress designs.

        <h3>Final Thought</h3>
        <p>Anna King Bridal was a fun design challenge for me to create a landing page that would meet the needs of the company and the users. I was able to research other sites and think about what a user would want and what I could do through my design to make a users experience good!  Whether I win the competition or not I’m pleased with what I was able to design.
